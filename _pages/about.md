Hi, I'm Lotte Bransen, a PhD student in the <a href="https://dtai.cs.kuleuven.be/" target="_blank">DTAI</a> research group at <a href="https://www.kuleuven.be/kuleuven/" target="_blank">KU Leuven</a>
under the supervision of Professor Jesse Davis. 
My research interests include the application of Data Science and Machine Learning techniques to (women's) football data. 
My current research focuses on the technical and tactical developments of women's football in recent years.

Prior to starting my PhD (in 2021) and SciSports job (in 2017), I obtained a Bachelor of Science degree in Mathematics from Utrecht University and a Master of Science degree in Econometrics & Management Science from Erasmus University Rotterdam.
